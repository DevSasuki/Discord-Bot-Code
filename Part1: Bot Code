-- Discord Bot Code; Part 1
# ALTHOUGH IT IS PART 1, IT'S STILL IN PERFECT WORKING ORDER, IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BOT RUN AND EXECUTE THE CMDS SHOWN, OR ADDED!
# IF THE CODE SOMEHOW DOES NOT WORK DUE TO AN ERROR, TRY UPDATING 'Discord.NET' AND 'Discord.NET Commands' IF YOU HAVE DONE THAT, TRY
# GETTING HELP TO FIX ERRORS AS IT IS NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY IF IT'S BROKEN!

# This code no longer works, it is programmed in C#, I'm going to keep it up for those who'd like to edit it and use that, but for anyone else, I won't be working on this anymore, JavaScript code soon
