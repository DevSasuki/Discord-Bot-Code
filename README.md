# Discord-Bot-Code / Fr33Software:
As you probably know, this repository comes from an organization called 'Fr33Software', Fr33Software produces free to use code, but it's not all free. There are copyright laws and certain rules, please read this before continuing.

# Broken / Old Code Fixing:
To do this, myself (and other contributors) will edit (this can mean non-staff/non-contrib, too) the code, if they're outdated they'll be fixed as fast as possible.
